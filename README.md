# Autoscroll.lua
Allows the use of middle mouse button to scroll like firefox's autoscroll. Click and hold middle mouse button and then drag the mouse in the direction you want. The farther away you drag the mouse to the point you clicked, the faster it will scroll. The closer you drag the mouse to the point you clicked, the slower it will scroll.
